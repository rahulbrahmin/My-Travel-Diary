            Srinagar Kashmiri pronunciation: [siriÀênagar]), is the largest city and the summer capital of the Indian-administered union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. It lies in the Kashmir Valley on the banks of the Jhelum River, a tributary of the Indus, and Dal and Anchar lakes. The city is known for its natural environment, gardens, waterfronts and houseboats. It is also known for traditional Kashmiri handicrafts like Kashmir shawls and also dried fruits. It is the northernmost city of India with over one million people.

            Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir is located in the heart of the Kashmir valley at an altitude of 1,730 m above sea level. Spread on both sides of the river Jhelum the city is famous for its natural beauty, gardens, waterfronts and houseboats. Srinagar is called the city of lakes and the Venice of the East, fascinating tourists from centuries with its beautiful picturesque Himalayan backdrop, glittering lakes that are surrounded by houseboats and Shikaras and the majesty of Mughal architecture. The very absence of order in the location of the houses and their tumbled down appearance add a peculiar charm to the scenery. It has its own quaint lifestyle, telling a panoramic fairytale tour through the snow-capped mountains and Chinar trees, while enjoying the adventurous pleasures of hiking, mountain biking, and rafting. The city is also famous for traditional Kashmiri handicrafts and dried fruits.

            In 1989, Srinagar became the focus of the insurgency against Indian rule. The area continues to be a highly politicised hotbed of separatist activity with frequent spontaneous protests and strikes ("bandhs" in local parlance). On 19 January 1990, the Gawakadal massacre of at least 50 unarmed protestors by Indian forces, and up to 280 by some estimates from eyewitness accounts, set the stage for bomb blasts, shootouts, and curfews that characterised Srinagar throughout the early and mid-1990s. As a result, bunkers and checkpoints are found throughout the city, although their numbers have come down in the past few years as militancy has declined. However, frequent protests still occur against Indian rule, such as the 22 August 2008 rally in which hundreds of thousands of Kashmiri civilians protested against Indian rule in Srinagar. Similar protests took place every summer for the next 4 years. In 2010 alone 120 protesters, many of whom were stone pelters and arsonists, were killed by police and CRPF. Large scale protests were seen following the execution of Afzal Guru in February 2013. In 2016, after the death of militant leader Burhan Wani, there were mass protests in the valley and about 87 protesters were killed by Indian Army, CRPF and police in the 2016 Kashmir unrest.
